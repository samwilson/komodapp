Kohana Module Application
=========================

It's just a Kohana PHP skeleton application in which everything is a module.
That's all.

# Installation

1. Copy `index.dist.php` to `index.php` and edit the values therein.
2. Copy `htaccess` to `.htaccess` (and uncomment and edit the `RewriteBase` directive if required).
